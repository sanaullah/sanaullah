### 🧭 About Me

I’m a **results-driven Senior Database Administrator** with **8+ years of SQL Server administration** and **20+ years across application, backend, and distributed systems engineering**.

I specialize in designing and operating **secure, high-availability, performance-tuned data platforms** that support **mission-critical enterprise systems**, particularly in **financial and ERP-driven environments**.

I bridge the gap between **deep database internals** and **modern application architecture**, helping teams replace brittle legacy integrations with scalable, service-oriented solutions.
