### About Me

I’m a results-driven Senior Database Administrator with over 8 years of hands-on SQL Server experience and more than 20 years in application, backend, and distributed systems engineering.

I focus on building and maintaining secure, high-availability, and high-performance data platforms that power mission-critical enterprise systems, especially within financial and ERP-driven environments..

With a strong foundation in both database internals and modern application architecture, I enjoy helping teams modernize legacy integrations and evolve them into scalable, service-oriented solutions that are reliable, maintainable, and built for growth.
